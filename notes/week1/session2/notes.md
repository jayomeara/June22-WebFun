There are other situations where elements do not have their margins collapsed:

floated elements
absolutely positioned elements
inline-block elements
elements with overflow property set to anything other than visible (They do not collapse margins with their children.)
cleared elements (They do not collapse their top margins with their parent blockâ€™s bottom margin.)
